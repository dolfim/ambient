{"name":"Ambient","tagline":"automatic parallelisation framework (distributed/shared memory)","body":"Ambient\r\n=======\r\n**C++ framework for application parallelisation under shared/distributed memory systems running Linux/OSX.**\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nAmbient is a header-only library (so just installing the sources is enough):  \r\n```sh\r\ncmake .  \r\nmake install\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nCompilation of the target application against Ambient's include folder with C++11 enabled is generally sufficient. Otherwise be sure to check the compilation options: threading backend and MPI mode are compiler-specific by default (so the respective compiler knobs might be needed). \r\n\r\nTo enforce threading backend or MPI mode use the following knobs:\r\n\r\n    -DAMBIENT_THREADING [CILK, OPENMP or SERIAL]  \r\n    -DAMBIENT_MPI [MPI_DISABLE or the desired MPI threading level]\r\n\r\n(Set AMBIENT_VERBOSE environment variable to see the resulting configuration).\r\n\r\nCheck the [developer's guide](http://ambient.comp-phys.org/guide.pdf) for more detailed information.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n    Distributed under the Boost Software License, Version 1.0.  \r\n    (See http://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
